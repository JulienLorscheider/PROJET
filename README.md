# Chess Variant Mini AI Game

This project is a mini chess variant game featuring an AI opponent. The game is played on a 4x4 board, offering a simplified yet strategic experience. Players can choose from three different game variants, each offering a unique set of pieces and strategies. The AI opponent uses a combination of evaluation functions, alpha-beta pruning, and threat assessments to challenge the player.

## Features

- **Three Game Variants**: Choose from three variants, each with a different combination of pieces:
  1. Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight
  2. Rook, Bishop, Knight, Pawn
  3. Rook, Bishop, Knight, King
- **Custom AI Opponent**: Play against an AI designed to evaluate the board, predict threats, and calculate the best moves based on the current game state.
- **Strategic Gameplay**: Despite the smaller board size, the game requires strategic thinking, piece placement, and anticipation of the opponent's moves.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Running the Game

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `Main.py` script to start the game:
   ```
   python Main.py
   ```

### How to Play

1. Choose a game variant by entering the corresponding number when prompted.
2. Follow the instructions to place your pieces on the board.
3. On your turn, choose a piece to move by entering its letter (Q for Queen, T for Rook, F for Bishop, C for Knight, P for Pawn, K for King).
4. Enter the current and new positions for your piece in the format `row,column` (e.g., `1,2`).
5. Watch as the AI calculates and makes its move.
6. The game ends when all pieces of one color are captured or other game-specific conditions are met.

## AI Strategy

The AI evaluates the board by considering:
- The positions of both its pieces and the player's pieces.
- Threats to its pieces and opportunities to capture player pieces.
- Strategic piece placements and potential future moves.

The AI uses alpha-beta pruning to explore possible moves efficiently, focusing on moves that improve its position while minimizing the potential gain for the opponent.

## Customizing the Game

- The game logic can be adjusted by modifying the evaluation functions and the depth of the search algorithm.
- Additional variants can be introduced by changing the starting pieces and their placement rules.
